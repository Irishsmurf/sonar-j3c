**C**overage / **C**omplexity **C**hart - Sonar Plugin

The **J3C Sonar Plugin** is a visualization technique that is useful to quick get an idea of how difficult is it to change / maintain your code. It combines the *Cyclomatic Complexity* and cod *Coverage* from automated tests and reveals if the code contains high risk to change methods. This plugin is inspired from [crap4j](http://www.crap4j.org/faq.html "crap4j") project and use the same heuristic complexity/coverage thresholds in order to interpret and render the results.

| Complexity    | Coverage %  |
| ------------- |-------------|
| 0 – 5         | 0%          |
| 6 – 10        | 42%         |
| 11 – 15       | 57%         |
| 16 – 20       | 71%         |
| 21 – 25       | 80%         |
| 26 – 30       | 100%        |
| 31+           | Time to refactor |
